Architecture

Clean architecture
  Domain - business entities and interfaces for repository/services
  Application - repository/service implementation, DTO
  Infrastructure - EF core, external services,
  API - endpoints

Mine
  API - endpoints
  Authentication - user login/external login (google) etc.
  Background Services - cronjobs
  Data - everything about the domain entities (data accesing, ef, validation)
  Domain - business entities and interfaces for repository/services
  Domain Services - service implementation
  Email  - email management
  Shared - DTO's

How clean architecture and relates to mine

Domain - Domain
Application - Data
Infrastructure - Authentication, Email, Background Services, Domain Services
API - API

Shared is external


reference tree
Shared -> Domain -> Data -> (Auth, Email, BG Services, Domain Services) -> API
